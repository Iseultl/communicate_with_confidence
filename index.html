    <h2>What I do</h2>
    <div class="about-content">
      <div class="about-text">
        <p>
          With over 20 years leading inclusive projects across Ireland and
          Southeast Asia, I bring together the precision of science and the
          energy of theatre to help people communicate with confidence, clarity,
          and presence. Communicate with Confidence is a 4-session course
          designed to equip students of all ages with essential communication and
          confidence-building skills. Using practical exercises and elements from
          performance training. This programme helps participants improve how
          they speak, listen, and engage — preparing them for interviews,
          presentations, exams, and life beyond the classroom.

    <h2>Why it matters</h2>
    <div class="about-content">
      <div class="about-text">
        <p>
          Whether you’re preparing for work experience, oral exams, a
          presentation, or a job interview, strong communication skills
          offer a lifelong advantage. This course goes beyond “getting
          through” an interview or presentation — it helps students thrive
          by building self-awareness, resilience, and the ability to
          confidently represent themselves.

    <h2>What people say</h2>

    <blockquote>
      “Before working with Theresa, I often felt hijacked by my nervous system in high-stakes meetings—flustered, overwhelmed, and unable to communicate effectively when it mattered most.
Theresa’s coaching was a game-changer. She combined neuroscience tools, practical strategies, and even acting techniques in a way that felt innovative, engaging, and tailored to me. The acting element was especially powerful, helping me embody new ways of showing up under pressure.
Now, instead of being overwhelmed, I have a clear toolkit that keeps me grounded and confident in crucial conversations. If you struggle with communication blocks, Theresa’s unique, mind-body approach creates real and lasting transformation.”
      <span>– Smaranda Maier, Founder of Authentic Health</span>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      “Ms Theresa played a pivotal role in building my confidence beyond school. Thanks to her guidance, I delivered a speech to 1,300 people at university with poise and received fantastic feedback.”
      <span>– Shre Kishan Manohar, UCSI University, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</span>
